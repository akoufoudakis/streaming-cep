= Streaming CEP

= SCENARIO (Design)

*TBD*

== Goals

Our goals based on the use case and implemented code is to show
* How it is possible to do CEP on top of OCP
* How to size such an environment
* What was the architecture (learnings good/bad)
* What was failover/scalability of the environment app (learnings good/bad)
* What was the performance (report on constraints)

*How/What To BenchMark* link:https://engineering.linkedin.com/kafka/benchmarking-apache-kafka-2-million-writes-second-three-cheap-machines[example]


== Architectures

=== Architecture 1 - In Stream CEP Processing (Preferable)
