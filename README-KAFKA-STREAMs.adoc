== STREAMS DSL

== STREAMS & State

Ingredients of state in streams
State is nothing more than the ability to recall information youâ€™ve seen before and connect it to current information. You can utilize state in different ways. 
* accumulation of values, provided by the Kafka Streams DSL.
* Joining of streams (closely related to the joins performed in database operations eg. such as joining records from the employee and department tables to generate a report on who staffs which departments
in a company.)
* What state needs to look like and what the requirements are for using state when we discuss state stores in Kafka Streams. 
* Importance of timestamps (ensuring you only work with events occurring within a given time frame or helping you work with data arriving out of order)
